## Notes & Troubleshooting

### How to set my own packs / background music?
1. You need to get the necessary files (.mp3 or .wav), rename them as steam files (check this in the folder steam -> steamui -> sound)
2. Put them into the folder and give it a unique name (This will be the name of you pack)
3. Choose "Add custom pack" and select your folder
4. Select this pack from the dropdown menu.
To set custom background music, do absolutely the same things

- Steam Deck theme is default theme.
